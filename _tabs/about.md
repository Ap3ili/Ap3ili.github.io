I've spent the last 3 years working with offensive security, with a strong focus on Linux and Active Directory.  
I split my time between studying to become a red teamer and completing CTFs on Hack The Box and other known platforms.

Outside of security, I love skateboarding, exploring the world, and collecting anime memorabilia.
